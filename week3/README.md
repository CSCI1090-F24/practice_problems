# Activities for Week 3

---

## `while` loops

### Exercise 1

1. Read in a integer between 1 and 10 from the user. 

2. Using a while loop, calculate that number to the 5th power.

3. Print out the result.

### Exercise 2

1. Ask the user to enter an integer.

2. Tell the user whether the integer is even or odd.

3. As long as the user enters an even integer, keep asking them for a new integer.
When they finally enter an odd integer, say goodbye and end the program.

## `for` loops

### Exercise 3
Implement Exercise 1, above, with a for loop.

### Exercise 4
Use a for loop to print out all the even numbers between 1 and 20.

---

## User-defined functions

### Exercise 5
Rewrite Exercise 1 with two functions: (1) a `power_five()` function that takes an integer as an argument, uses a for loop or while loop to calculate that integer to the fifth power, and prints it out. (2) a `main()` function that reads in the user's integer and calls `power_five()` on that integer.

## Using for i in range() with 2 or 3 arguments.

### Exercise 1
Print out all the integers between 3 and 15 (not including 15).

### Exercise 2
Add up all the odd numbers between 3 and 15 (including 15).

### Exercise 3
Print out the numbers divisible by 5 starting with 50 and going down to 5 (including 5).

---

## print()

### Exercise 4
Get a word from the user and print it out with an asterisk after each letter.

### Exercise 5
Get three numbers from the user then print them out with no spaces between them and a question mark instead of a new line.

---

## f-strings

### Exercise 6
Do exercise 5 using f-strings.

### Exercise 7
Get a name and age from the user. Print out a message reporting the name and the user's age divided by 7 formatted to 2 decimal places.


## writing out to a file with open() and write()

### Exercise 8
Get a user's name, age, major, and year. Then print out each item to a file called `mytext.txt` with one item per line.


## reading in a file with open() and readline()

### Exercise 9
Read in the file `mytext.txt` line by line. Print out each line in all caps. (Some lines are just numbers, so they will look the same.)
