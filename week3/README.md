# Activities for Week 3

---

## `while` loops

### Exercise 1

1. Read in a integer between 1 and 10 from the user. 

2. Using a while loop, calculate that number to the 5th power.

3. Print out the result.

### Exercise 2

1. Ask the user to enter an integer.

2. Tell the user whether the integer is even or odd.

3. As long as the user enters an even integer, keep asking them for a new integer.
When they finally enter an odd integer, say goodbye and end the program.

## `for` loops

### Exercise 3
Implement Exercise 1, above, with a for loop.

### Exercise 4
Use a for loop to print out all the even numbers between 1 and 20.

## User-defined functions

### Exercise 5
Rewrite Exercise 1 with two functions: (1) a `power_five()` function that takes an integer as an argument, uses a for loop or while loop to calculate that integer to the fifth power, and prints it out. (2) a `main()` function that reads in the user's integer and calls `power_five()` on that integer.
