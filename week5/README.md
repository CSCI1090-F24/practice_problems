# Week 6 Section Activities

### Functions that return a value

1a. Write a function that takes three integer arguments and PRINTS OUT the smallest value.

1b. Write a function that takes three integer arguments and RETURNS the smallest value. Have your `main()` function call this function three times, each time saving the return value to a variable. Then print out all three values in one print statement.

1c. Do the same as 1b, but in `main(`) don't save the return values out to variables. Instead, provide the function calls as arguments in `print()`.

2. Write a function that take two strings and returns a string containing the common characters in those two strings. In the `main()` function, print out the return value in two different ways.

### Functions with multiple return statements

3. Write a function that takes two string arguments. Return `True` if the first string comes before the first in the alphabet. Otherwise return `False`. In the `main(`) function, use this function to print out which string is earlier in the alphabet than the other.

4. Write a function that takes an integer argument, `n`. Using a for loop starting at `i=10` and going all the way down 1, check to see if `i` is a divisor of `n`. If it is, immediately return i. If you get all the way through the for loop, then return 1. In the `main()` function, use this function to print out a message like "The largest divisor of your number that is less than 10 is..." whatever gets returned by the function.

### Functions that return multiple values

5. Write a function that returns the min, max, and average of three integer arguments. In the `main()` function print out these values.

6. Write a function that takes two string arguments and returns a string containing all the vowels shared in both strings and its length. Print them both out in `main()`.


### Using Python modules
7. Using `random()`, write a function that generates random integers between 1 and 100 until you get one divisible 7. Return the number you get, and in the `main()` function, print out that number.

8. Using `math()`, experiment with `.floor(), .factorial(), log(), sqrt()`.
